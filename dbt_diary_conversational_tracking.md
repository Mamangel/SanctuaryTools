# DBT Diary Card - Conversational Tracking Alternative

**For:** People who need DBT tracking but forms trigger anxiety

**Method:** End-of-day conversation instead of filling out paper diary card

---

## The Problem

Standard DBT Diary Cards require:
- Rating 10+ emotions on 0-5 scale
- Tracking target behaviors (urges vs acts)
- Checking off 40+ skills across 4 categories
- Filling this out DAILY

**For people with:**
- Form anxiety
- Executive function challenges
- Perfectionism paralysis
- Ultra-rapid cycling (too many states to remember at 9 PM)

**Traditional diary cards become barriers instead of tools.**

---

## The Solution: Conversational Tracking

**End-of-day conversation with AI assistant, support person, or voice recorder:**

Instead of staring at a blank form, you answer questions conversationally. Someone (or AI) formats it into diary card structure for your therapist.

---

## How It Works

### Daily Routine (2-3 minutes at bedtime):

**Emotions Check-In:**
"How intense were these today, 0-5?"
- Suicidal thoughts
- Anger
- Sadness
- Fear
- Shame
- Joy/relief

*(Skip emotions that clearly weren't present - only ask about relevant ones)*

**Target Behaviors:**
"Did you have urges or actually do any of these?"
- Suicidal thoughts (urge? act?)
- Self-harm (urge? act?)
- Substance use (yes/no, what substance)
- [Other targets your therapist identifies]

**Skills Used:**
"Which DBT skills did you try today?"
- List the ones that came up naturally
- You confirm or add any missed

**That's it.**

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI helping someone track DBT diary cards conversationally:

**Daily routine (when user says "good night"):**

1. Ask about emotions (only relevant ones based on the day)
2. Ask about target behaviors (therapist-identified)
3. Ask which skills they used
4. Note any major events or context
5. Save to tracking file in format above

**Weekly:**
Generate summary for therapist session

**Export options:**
- Keep as markdown (readable format)
- Convert to PDF if needed
- Therapist can read conversational entries OR use traditional diary card grid

---

## Advantages Over Traditional Diary Card

✅ No blank form staring back at you
✅ Conversational flow (easier for auditory/verbal processors)
✅ Based on actual day data, not trying to remember at 9 PM
✅ More context than numbers alone
✅ Integrated with other tracking (if using mood tracking systems)
✅ Can dictate/voice record if writing is hard
✅ Captures WHY emotions were rated that way

## Talking to Your Therapist About This

**Script:**
"The diary card form triggers anxiety for me. I've been tracking the same information conversationally [with AI/support person/voice recorder] instead. Can I bring you this format, or do you need the traditional grid?"

**Most DBT therapists will say:**
The CONTENT matters, not the form. If you're tracking emotions, behaviors, and skills daily, the format is negotiable.

**What matters to them:**
- You're tracking consistently
- They can see patterns
- You're being honest
- Skills practice is documented

---

## Integration with Other Tools

**If you're also using:**
- Ultra-rapid cycling mood tracking (see rapid_cycling_tracker_template.md)
- Episode tracking (see episode_tracker_template.md)

**You can cross-reference:**
- Mood shift data informs emotion ratings
- Crisis episodes get documented in both places
- Skills used during rapid cycling get tracked

**This creates comprehensive documentation for both psychiatric care AND disability applications.**

---

## Important Notes

**This is NOT a replacement for DBT therapy.**
This is an accommodation for the tracking component when traditional forms don't work.

**Your therapist needs to:**
- Confirm which target behaviors YOU specifically should track
- Know you're using this method
- Receive your tracking data weekly

**You still need:**
- To attend DBT skills training
- To practice skills between sessions
- To bring tracking to therapy appointments
- To be honest about urges/behaviors even when hard

## File Structure Suggestion

```
/dbt_tracking/
  ├── week1_oct17-23.md
  ├── week2_oct24-30.md
  ├── week3_oct31-nov6.md
  └── [etc]
```

Or single file with all weeks:
```
dbt_diary_tracking.md
```

Weekly backups recommended.

---

**Remember: The goal is tracking that actually happens, not perfect forms you avoid filling out.**

If conversational tracking gets it done, it's the right tool.
