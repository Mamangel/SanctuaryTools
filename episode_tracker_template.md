## Example Entries

### October 11, 2025 - Severe Emotional Dysregulation Crisis

**Time:** Most of the day

**Episode Type:** Severe emotional distress / BPD crisis with bipolar cycling

**What happened:** Crying most of the day, severe emotional dysregulation, BPD symptoms very active, unable to regulate emotions

**Trigger:** Multiple stressors stacking - unemployment denial, period starting, hot flashes (perimenopause), hormone fluctuations all hitting at once

**Physical symptoms:** Crying jag lasting most of day, emotionally overwhelmed, physical exhaustion

**Cognitive symptoms:** Unable to think clearly, emotional reasoning dominant, black-and-white thinking

**Behavioral symptoms:** Got into fight with partner (BPD emotional intensity), tried to manage but couldn't regulate

**What I did:** Attempted to use coping skills, reached out to partner (though conflict resulted), tried to ride it out

**What others did:** Partner engaged but conflict ensued due to intensity of my dysregulation

**Duration:** Most of Saturday (8+ hours)

**How it ended:** Exhausted myself, eventually shifted to flat/numb recovery mode the next day

**Impact:** Lost entire day to emotional crisis, relationship conflict with partner, complete emotional depletion following day

**Medical intervention:** None during - already established with treatment team

**Medications during episode:**
- Current daily meds: Buspirone 15mg 2x/day, Lurasidone 20mg evening, Meloxicam 15mg, Pioglitazone 15mg
- PRN meds used: Cannabis for emotional regulation
- Changes made: None during episode - Lamotrigine added days later

**Notes:** Perfect storm - BPD + period + hot flashes + unemployment stress all hit at once. Hormone fluctuations from period likely intensified perimenopause symptoms. Classic pattern after major stressor triggers both BPD and bipolar symptoms simultaneously.

### October 10, 2025 - Dissociative Episode

**Time:** Noticed in afternoon, unclear when it actually occurred

**Episode Type:** Dissociation - lost time, memory gap, confusion between mental events and reality

**What happened:** Had full conversation about SSI phone appointment (scheduled for Nov 24, 11am) in my head. Believed I told partner and others about it. Never said anything out loud. Filed mental conversation as "done" when it never happened.

**Trigger:** Unknown - possibly stress/financial anxiety

**Physical symptoms:** None noticed during episode - memory gap/confusion when realized it never happened

**Cognitive symptoms:** Time distortion, confusion between internal mental events and external reality, memory gap

**Behavioral symptoms:** Failed to communicate important information, thought task was complete when it wasn't

**What I did:** Recognized it when realized no one knew about appointment, documented it for treatment team

**What others did:** Partner confirmed conversation never happened (reality check)

**Duration:** Unknown - unclear when the mental conversation happened vs when real events occurred

**How it ended:** Awareness when realized task wasn't actually completed

**Impact:** Failed to communicate important information, thought task was complete when it wasn't, could have missed important appointment

**Medical intervention:** Documented for therapist and psychiatrist

**Medications during episode:**
- Current daily meds: Buspirone 15mg 2x/day, Lurasidone 20mg evening, Meloxicam 15mg, Pioglitazone 15mg
- PRN meds used: None during
- Changes made: None

**Notes:** This type of dissociation affects work capability - can't distinguish mental conversations from real ones, leads to communication failures and incomplete tasks. Important for SSDI documentation. Shows cognitive impairment even when not in obvious crisis.

### October 4, 2025 - Dual Crisis Day

**Time:** Started ~7:00am

**Episode Type:** Depression wave + Sensory overload crisis

**Episode 1 - Depression Wave:**

**What happened:** Depression wave hit hard, crying jag started

**Trigger:** Woke up depressed, too much sleep pulling toward depression (10 hours - past sweet spot)

**Physical symptoms:** Crying uncontrollably, overwhelmed, couldn't stop

**What I did:** Called ex-husband to talk through it (he knows my patterns)

**Duration:** ~2 hours

**How it ended:** UPS crisis interrupted it, shifted focus

**Episode 2 - Sensory Overload:**

**Time:** ~9:00am (while still on phone with ex)

**What happened:** UPS battery failure - loud beeping noise triggered severe sensory overload

**Trigger:** Unexpected loud noise (sensory processing issues)

**Physical symptoms:** Heart racing, adrenaline spike, felt like climbed a mountain, sensory issues triggered badly

**What I did:** Unplugged UPS, moved devices to power strip, handled crisis while still on phone with ex

**Duration:** ~30 minutes of active crisis, longer recovery

**How it ended:** Fixed the problem, sat down, cannabis helped bring adrenaline down

**Impact:** Lost morning to dual crises, ate 2 croissants somewhere in mix (emotional eating), time distortion/dissociation during episodes

**Medications during episode:**
- Current daily meds: Buspirone 15mg 2x/day, Lurasidone 20mg evening, Meloxicam 15mg, Pioglitazone 15mg
- PRN meds used: Cannabis post-crisis for regulation
- Changes made: None

**Notes:** Too much sleep (10 hours) triggered depressive state. Sensory issues from beeping noise set off full adrenaline response. Dissociation during episode (lost track of time). Ex-husband support helpful - having someone who knows patterns helps.
