## Standard Questions to Ask

### 1. Clinical Assessment

**Prompt:**
```
I'm attaching my rapid cycling tracker data from [date]. Please analyze:

1. Is this cycling pattern documented in medical literature?
2. What is the clinical term for this severity?

Context:
- [When it happened, what state you were in, what triggered it]

Questions:
1. Does this behavior constitute self-harm requiring escalation?
2. Should I be in more intensive treatment?
3. What safety planning do I need?
4. How do I bring this up with my therapist?
5. At what point should I go to ER vs. wait for next appointment?
```

**What you'll get:**
- Risk assessment
- Treatment intensity recommendations
- Safety planning guidance
- Communication strategy for providers

### 5. Pattern Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Here's my tracking data for the past [week/month]:

[Paste your tracking data]

Please identify:
1. Time-of-day patterns (when am I most unstable?)
2. Trigger patterns (what consistently causes shifts?)
3. Duration patterns (how long do states typically last?)
4. Intervention effectiveness (what actually helps?)
5. Warning signs (early indicators of crisis?)
6. Protective factors (what prevents escalation?)
```

**What you'll get:**
- Data-driven insights
- Predictive patterns
- Targeted intervention suggestions
- Early warning system

---

### 6. Treatment Comparison

**Prompt:**
```
I'm considering these treatment options:

Option A: [Describe - e.g., "Increase current medication"]
Option B: [Describe - e.g., "Add new mood stabilizer"]
Option C: [Describe - e.g., "Try DBT therapy"]

Given my ultra-rapid cycling pattern, please compare:
1. Evidence base for each option in ultra-ultradian cycling
2. Risks and benefits of each
3. Expected timeline for results
4. What monitoring is needed
5. Which option(s) you'd recommend prioritizing and why
```

**What you'll get:**
- Evidence-based comparison
- Pros/cons analysis
- Strategic recommendation
- Questions to ask your doctor

## Advanced Questions

### For Genetic Testing Discussion:

```
Should I pursue pharmacogenetic testing given:
- [Number] medication trials with insufficient response
- Ultra-rapid cycling severity
- [Any adverse reactions you've had]

What would genetic testing tell me, and is it worth the cost?
```

### For Trauma/PTSD Evaluation:

```
My psychiatrist suggested trauma evaluation. Given:
- Dissociative episodes [describe]
- [Any trauma history you're comfortable sharing]
- Current symptom pattern

Should trauma treatment be prioritized alongside bipolar treatment?
How do trauma and bipolar interact in ultra-rapid cycling?
```

### For Treatment Resistance:

```
I've tried [number] medications without adequate stabilization.

Evidence I'm treatment-resistant:
- [List meds tried and results]

Options for treatment-resistant bipolar:
1. What treatments are evidence-based for my severity?
2. Should I consider ECT, TMS, or ketamine?
3. What clinical trials might be relevant?
```

## Interpreting AI Responses

### What AI Can Do Well:
✅ Identify patterns in your data
✅ Provide research-backed information
✅ Suggest questions for your doctor
✅ Frame your experience using clinical terminology
✅ Strategic planning for SSDI/disability
✅ Compare treatment options based on evidence

### What AI Cannot Do:
❌ Diagnose you (you already have diagnosis)
❌ Prescribe medications
❌ Replace your treatment team
❌ Provide emergency crisis intervention

## Sample Keira Session

**You:**
```
You are Keira, a strategic medical advisor.

I have Bipolar I with ultra-rapid cycling. Today I experienced 12+ mood states in 9 hours. During this, I:
- Completed 8 job applications
- Had suicidal ideation requiring partner intervention
- Engaged in pain-seeking behavior (burning water)
- Cycled through hypomania with hypersexual impulses

I'm on Day 2 of Lamotrigine 25mg. Is this medication response normal, or is the cycling worsening due to the new med?
```

**Keira (AI):**
```
[Provides analysis of whether Day 2 Lamotrigine could be contributing, discusses expected adjustment period, recommends monitoring schedule, suggests safety precautions, and advises when to contact psychiatrist]
```

**You:**
```
How do I present this to my psychiatrist tomorrow? What specific data points should I emphasize?
```

**Keira (AI):**
```
[Provides structured talking points, priority issues to raise, questions to ask doctor, and data to highlight from your tracking]
```
