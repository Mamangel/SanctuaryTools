## Examples

### Example 1: Crisis Shift

**Date:** 2025-10-15

**Time:** 12:00 PM

**Previous mood state:** Functional - working on job applications

**Current mood state:** Severe panic with suicidal ideation

**Trigger:** Received job rejection email while already stressed about finances

**Physical symptoms:** Crying uncontrollably, chest tight, throat hurts, can't catch breath

**What you're doing:** Had to stop working, called support person

**Functionality level:**
- [x] Cannot function (crisis/frozen/suicidal)

**Notes:** Called partner for support. Recognized I shouldn't be alone. This is "the door opening" - my standard severe crisis pattern.

### Example 2: Spontaneous Upshift

**Date:** 2025-10-15

**Time:** 1:30 PM

**Previous mood state:** Neutral/stable after sitting and breathing

**Current mood state:** Hypomanic - high energy, expansive thinking

**Trigger:** Unknown - spontaneous shift

**Physical symptoms:** Energized, restless, want to do ALL the things, hypersexual impulses present

**What you're doing:** Cooking elaborate meal, doing dishes, making plans

**Functionality level:**
- [x] High function (productive, clear thinking, energized)

## Tips for Using This Template

1. **Keep it nearby** - Have this template accessible on your phone or computer so you can log immediately when shifts happen

2. **Don't wait** - Log the shift as soon as you notice it, even if you're mid-crisis. Brief entries are better than perfect ones written later.

3. **Be specific** - "Anxious" is less useful than "heart racing, can't sit still, catastrophizing about money"

4. **Track spontaneous shifts** - Even if you don't know the trigger, log it. Patterns may emerge over time.

5. **Functionality is key** - This helps show disability reviewers that you can't sustain work even when you're "productive"

6. **Review patterns** - At end of day/week, look for recurring triggers and time patterns
